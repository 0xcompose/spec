# Spec

Spec comes from `specification`. Often smart contract repos lack detailed of even general description of what repo and smart contracts in it are doing. Only AIs can understand what's going (not always). So for sake of development and review simplicity this tool was created.

This is a reincarnation of `scopelint`'s `spec` command, which generated specification for source smart contract based on test files and test names.

Such functionality helps not only understanding your own suites of tests, but also review other's repos.
